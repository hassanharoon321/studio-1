Here is the checklist for a strong credit profile that can achieve a high Unlock Score:
${checklist}

Now, analyze the following credit report:
Credit Report: {{media url=creditReportDataUri}}

Instructions:
1.  Parse the credit report to identify key metrics like FICO score, payment history, credit utilization, number and type of accounts, credit history length, and inquiries.
2.  Compare the user's profile against each item in the checklist.
3.  For the "Summary", provide a short, clear overview of where the user's credit profile stands.
4.  For the "Action Items", create a list of specific, actionable steps the user should take to meet the checklist criteria. Be direct and provide concrete examples.
5.  **Crucially, identify all potentially disputable negative items in the report. For each item, create an entry in the 'disputableItems' array.**
    -   Provide the 'item' name (e.g., "Collection from XYZ Corp").
    -   Provide a 'reason' why it might be disputable (e.g., "No validation provided," "Account is older than 7 years").
    -   Estimate a 'successProbability' as a percentage (e.g., 65 for a moderately likely success, 85 for a highly likely success). This should be a number from 0 to 100.

Generate the complete analysis and provide the output in the specified JSON format.
