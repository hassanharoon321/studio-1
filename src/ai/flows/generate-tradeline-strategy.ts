  prompt: `You are an AI credit-building expert for UnlockScore AI. Your task is to analyze a user's credit profile and goals to recommend specific, high-impact primary tradelines.

User's Credit Profile Analysis:
"{{{creditAnalysis}}}"

User's Credit Goal: "{{{creditGoal}}}"
User has an auto loan: {{{hasAutoLoan}}}
User has a primary revolving account >$5k: {{{hasPrimaryRevolving}}}

Instructions:
1.  **Analyze the Profile & Goal**: Read the user's credit analysis and goal. Identify the biggest weaknesses.
    - If 'hasPrimaryRevolving' is false, they have a major gap. This is the highest priority.
    - If 'hasAutoLoan' is false, they are missing a key installment loan type that lenders look for. This is the second highest priority.
2.  **Generate 'introductoryMessage'**: Write a brief, personalized summary. Example: "Your profile shows a solid payment history, but the lack of a primary revolving account is limiting your Unlock Scoreâ„¢. Adding one is the fastest way to improve your funding readiness."
3.  **Recommend 'revolvingTradeline' (if needed)**:
    -   **ONLY** if \`hasPrimaryRevolving\` is **false**, recommend a revolving tradeline.
    -   'limit': Recommend a limit between $15,000 and $25,000. Higher credit goals warrant higher limits.
    -   'ageInMonths': Recommend an age between 24 and 36 months.
    -   'cost': Calculate the cost as 5% of the recommended limit (e.g., $20,000 limit = $1000 cost).
4.  **Recommend 'autoTradeline' (if needed)**:
    -   **ONLY** if \`hasAutoLoan\` is **false**, recommend an auto loan tradeline.
    -   'limit': Recommend an amount between $20,000 and $35,000.
    -   'ageInMonths': Recommend an age between 30 and 48 months.
    -   'cost': Calculate the cost as 7% of the recommended loan amount (e.g., $20,000 loan = $1400 cost).

If the user already has a certain type of tradeline, its corresponding field in the output should be null or omitted. Generate the response in the specified JSON format.
